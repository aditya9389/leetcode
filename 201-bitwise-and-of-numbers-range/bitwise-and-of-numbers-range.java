// Lets manually apply & operation on all elements present in the 
// range 5 and 7 including themself.

//             5 = 101
//             6 = 110
//             7 = 111

// AND operations:
//             0 & 0 = 0
//             0 & 1 = 0
//             1 & 0 = 0
//             1 & 1 = 1

// With the help of above operations lets perform AND operations.

//             101(5) & 110(6) = 100(4)

//             100(4) & 111(7) = 100(4)

//     answer = 4


// Now lets apply the method used in the code:

// we will remove last digit from binary representation of both left
// and right number until we reach a point where both have same 
// element at the same position.
// And will also keep track of how many times we removed elements 
// by keeping a count of it.

// lets apply it practically:

// first loop:
//             101 >> 1 = 10
//             111 >> 1 = 11
//             cnt = 1

// Second loop:
//             10 >> 1 = 1
//             11 >> 1 = 1
//             cnt = 2

// Third loop:
//             1 == 1 
// So now since they are equal we will add those many 0's at the 
// end of the current element we have by using left shift operator.

//             1 << cnt  = 1 << 2  => 100(4) 


//     Result = 4
//copied but well understood
